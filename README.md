📦 Folder Structure

├── data.py            # MySQL database connection logic

⚠️ Notes

	•	This project assumes you have a MySQL database configured.
	•	If you don’t have MySQL installed, you can still explore the GUI by commenting out the DB-related lines in data.py.
	•	Future versions can include SQLite or a mock DB for easier testing.
